*Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.*

> The project is an application for the supposed client Corner Grocer. The application receives a file that has the items sold in chronological and Corner Grocer wants to see how many of the items it sold for remodeling purposes.

*What did you do particularly well?*

> I'm not sure if there is anything done well but I'd like to think that the organization and execution are well done.

*Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?*

> I see plenty of room for enhancements and improvements. One such example is how the program does not keep track of when the items were purchased chronologically, it only keeps track of the first time a type of item was purchased. It wouldn't help through efficiency but would with delivery. The application is generally secure. It follows general secure coding practices such as ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability).

*Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? what tools or resources are you adding to your support network?*

> The most difficult part of the code to write was getting all of the menu functions inside of resource files and using them as intended. Specifically, there was an exception it would throw for one of the menu functions accessing a non-member item. To overcome this, I retyped the code with a few different methods and one didn't have issues.
  
*What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or coursework?*

> I've greatly benefited in how I understand pointers, how they work, and how to use them throughout the course. I have also improved at using Visual Studio, though I would like to get into NeoVim.

*How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?*

> To make the program maintainable, readable, and adaptable I documented all of the functions with specific comments. I also got set on making the main program file as minimal as possible. To do this I set all functions in resource files specific to uses. This allows any developer to understand, modify, and expand the code in an easy and replicable manner.
